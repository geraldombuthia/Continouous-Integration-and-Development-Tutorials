# Continous Integration and Continous Delivery/Deployment (CI/CD)

CI is a modern software development practice in which incremental code changes are made frequently and reliably.

Automated build-and-test steps triggered by CI ensure that code changes being merged into the repository are reliable. 

The code is then delivered quickly and seamlessly as a part of the CD process. 

In the software world, the CI/CD pipeline refers to the automation that enables incremental code changes from developersâ€™ desktops to be delivered quickly and reliably to production. They are supported by development and operations teams working together in an agile way with either a DevOps or site reliability engineering (SRE) approach.

## Importance of CI/CD
CI/CD allows organizations to ship software quickly and efficiently. 
CI/CD facilitates an effective process for getting products to market faster than ever before, continuously delivering code into production, and ensuring an ongoing flow of new features and bug fixes via the most efficient delivery method. 

## Difference between CI and CD
CI involves the practice of developers making small changes and checks to their code. This checks are automated to ensure that teams build, test and package their applications in a reliable and repeatable way. CI helps streamline code changes thereby increasing time for developers to make changes and contibute to improved software.

CDelivery is the automated delivery of completed code to environments like testing and development providing a consistent way and for code to be delivered to these environments.

CDeployment is the next step of contnous delivery. Every change that passes he automated tests is automatically placed in production, resulting in many production deployments. Should be the goal of most companies that are not constrained by regulatory or other requirements.
